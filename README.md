# django-yaml-db
Sync between yaml files and the database


Main question: Is it possible to faithfully represent [complex graph-like data models](docs/images/graph_models_only.png) as YAML files?



TODO
----
  - Add commands to simple project to import/export Album/Track data
  - Test git commit workflow
  - Add Artist<--many-to-many-->Track
    - Serialize data multiple times?
